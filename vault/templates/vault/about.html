                <p>Firstly, I would like to shout out the <a href="https://github.com/viper-framework">Viper-Framework</a> who has been the main inspiration /
                motivation for this project. I have been using Viper for a while now and I love it. I wanted to build on the idea and taylor it for my own needs.
                This project is also a way for me to learn more about Python and Django web framework. I have used python for scripting and API integratoins but never 
                really had the time to learn Django.</p>

                <p>It is my hope that this project will be useful to others and that it will grow into something that is useful to the community.</p>
